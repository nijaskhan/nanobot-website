                    messages. This means that your

                        Your messages are transmitted and processed through WhatsApp’s infrastructure, and WhatsApp may
                        have access to message content

                    <li>Using encryption in transit (for example, HTTPS) where appropriate.</li>
                    <li>Applying role-based access controls so that only authorized personnel can access user data for

                    <li>Your full name (if known to us).</li>
                    <li>Your WhatsApp phone number (including country code).</li>
                    <li>A short description of your request (for example, delete all chat history associated with your
                        number).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Once we receive your request, we will review it and take reasonable steps to delete or de-identify
                    your data from our active systems,
                    unless we are required or permitted to keep it for legal, security, or operational reasons (for
                    example, to comply with record-keeping
                    requirements or to prevent fraud).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deletion from backups and archives may take additional time, but we will aim not to use your data
                    for active processing once your request
                    has been confirmed.

                <p>
                    Where we share data with such providers, we aim to do so only as needed for them to provide their
